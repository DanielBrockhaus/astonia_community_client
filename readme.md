# Astonia Community Client

This is the community client for Astonia 3. It is based on, and compatible
with, the [client maintained by Daniel Brockhaus:](https://github.com/DanielBrockhaus/astonia_community_client).

The main goal is to allow community driven development.

Further goals:

- Maintain backwards compatibility with the original game server.
- Maintain compatibility with all servers currently using the client.
- Keep it simple. No additional libraries, frameworks, tools unless absolutely needed.
- Whenever possible, put bugfixes in single commits for easy cherry-picking.
